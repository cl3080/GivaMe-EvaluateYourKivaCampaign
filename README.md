# GivaMe! A web app to evaluate your Kiva campaign
<p align="justify">
Kiva.org, a microfinance plaform, has crow-funded more than a million loans, totaling over $1 billion. Since 2012, however, there is a significant amount of non-funded kiva loans. In United States, the failure rate in terms of acquiring loan funding on Kiva is as high as 30%.

To help users on Kiva get some priori insights on their loan requests promotions, I built a web app that can predict the chance of a loan request being fully funded and provide suggestions on improving the context of the campaign website. 

The pipeline for modeling is shown as following:
