# GivaMe! A web app to evaulate your Kiva campaign
<p align="justify">
Kiva.org, a microfinance plaform, has crow-funded more than a million loans, totaling over $1 billion. Since 2012, however, there is a significant amount of non-funded kiva loans. In United States, the failure rate in terms of acquiring loan funding on Kiva is as high as 30%.
